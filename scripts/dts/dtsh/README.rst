**DTSh** is a Devicetree Source (DTS) files viewer with a *shell-like* command line interface:

- navigate and visualize the devicetree through a hierarchical
  file-system metaphor
- search for devices, bindings, buses or interrupts with flexible criteria
- redirect command output to files (text, HTML, SVG) to document
  hardware configurations or illustrate notes
- rich CLI, command line auto-completion, command history, user themes
